# Kevin Kwon's Portfolio

A personal webpage created using React with styled components. The goal of this project was to have a webpage
that details my past experiences and work, with a responsive UI/UX.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn deploy`

After making changes to the webpage, run this command to push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch and deploy a production
build to the specified URL.

### `yarn upgrade`

Upgrades all the dependencies you have
